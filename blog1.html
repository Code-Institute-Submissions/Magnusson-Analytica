      <h1>The 4 Stages of Design</h1>
      <div class="blog-subheader">

        <h2>
          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          You’ve done it. 2 months in the making, countless hours drilling through and cleaning data, choosing and creating the appropriate charts and, let’s face it, entire evenings going through different colour pallets! Mid-afternoon and your final dashboard handoff session comes around and, eager to impress, you set up the room to show off your baby. But, one long hour later, you come out disheartened. They didn’t like it, why? It’s a difficult question to ask yourself, literally and emotionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally we find that a user will make up their mind if they like a dashboard within the first few seconds of seeing it. Now, the psychology of why human’s “like” or “dislike” something is infinitely complex; many studies show that there is often no quantitative, tangible reasoning behind our likes and dislikes – it’s just a feeling we have. Within the world of User Experience (UX) design this is still true, yet we have managed to find ways, or practices, to create more favourable dashboards for our users. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You may well have followed many of these practices, yet your boss was still unhappy, and the primary reason for this is around personal tailoring – putting the user first. This can sound like a very simple concept but is frequently hard to achieve completely. One of the best ways to apply UX design practices, whilst putting the users’ interests first, is through the “Four Stages of Design”.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand and incorporate the 4 stages into our own dashboard projects, we must first understand some basic principles behind Dashboard UX design.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <h2>
          Basic Dashboard UX Design Principles
        </h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, you are not only responsible for how effectively someone can extract data and insight from your dashboard, but you are also responsible for how they feel whilst they are using your dashboard. It is important to focus on how to make your user feel empowered and in control, rather than frustrated and confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, a dashboard is a journey, although some should be more explorative than others:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A dashboard can simply inform a user. It can have very few controls and one, clearly laid out path, set out by the dashboard creator
            </li>
            <li>
              A dashboard can be used to drill down into detail, with a specific overall view and multiple paths drilling down from that single point of origin
            </li>
            <li>
              A dashboard can be an explorer’s tool, with interconnected paths drilling down and across from multiple points of origin
            </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Dashboards become harder and harder to design as more freedom is provided to the user – controls may be given to the user in order that they may feel free and empowered, but constraints must still exist so your user doesn’t become lost and confused. Bear this in mind when deciding what type of dashboard to provide for your users
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, dashboard design has 5 layers:
        </p>
        <div class="iceberg">
          <div class="iceberg-image">
            <img src="assets/images/blogs/iceberg.JPG" alt="iceberg-5-layers">
          </div>
          <div class="iceberg-text">
          <h3>
            Surface (Visual Design)
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is the part everyone thinks about when it comes to design, it’s the colours, the chart types, your font styles and your placements. 
          </p>
          <p>
            These are key to providing a pleasant view of your dashboard – something users will want to look at
          </p>
          <h3>
            Structure (Placement / Wireframe)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Dashboard must have a coherent structure, with certain groups of data being placed next to each other to make logical sense
          </p>
          <h3>
            User Flow (Screen Flow / Map)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Is your dashboard a single screen? Does it have multiple paginated views? Is it one scrolling page? 
          </p>
          <p>
            You must understand how your users will use the dashboard; understand where they will go first and which links they will use to navigate through your dashboard to get the answers they desire.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Scope (Focus / Requirements)
          </h3>
          <p>
            One of the easiest layers to get wrong. What needs to go in the dashboard? And more importantly, what is it not trying to answer? Try not to overload a dashboard with tonnes of information, it will not only overload the dashboard but overload the user too. Simplicity is key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Antoine de Saint-Exupery famously said
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
        	<em>
              “Perfection is achieved, not when <strong>there is nothing more</strong> to add, but when <strong>there is nothing left to take away.</strong>”
            </em>
          </p>
          <h3>
            Strategy (User Research)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Who is the real user? Is it the one giving you the project, or are they requesting it for someone else? Try not to mistake stakeholders for users. Usually this is the case with managers, where the true users are in fact the team members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have successfully identified your users what are their problems and pain points?

        <h2>The 4 Stages of Design</h2>
        <p>
          Great. We understand our UX design principles, now we must put them into practice. To allow us some order to our thoughts, an ensure no principle is overlooked, we encompass them within a design process. As you may have guessed by now, this process has 4 stages, which are: <strong>Discover</strong>, <strong>Nurture</strong>, <strong>Ideate</strong> and <strong>Validate</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="flow-chart">
          <div id="discover">
            <h3>
              Discover
            </h3>
            <i class="fas fa-search"></i>
            <p><em>Who is using this dashboard?</em></p>
          </div>
          <div id="nurture">
            <h3>
              Nurture
            </h3>
            <i class="fas fa-seedling"></i>
            <p><em>What are their main goals?</em></p>
          </div>
          <div id="ideate">
            <h3>
              Ideate
            </h3>
            <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i>
            <p><em>How can we make them successful?</em></p>
          </div>
          <div id="validate">
            <h3>
              Validate
            </h3>
            <i class="fas fa-check"></i>
            <p><em>Where can I improve the Dashboard?</em></p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <h2>1) Discover</h2>
        <p>
          In this stage, you must find your user. A 'job' will often come from a Hippo - a <strong>Hi</strong>ghly <strong>P</strong>aid <strong>P</strong>erson's <strong>O</strong>pinion - these are not the end users, but you may find that the end users are members of their team. A Hippo may be defined as a Stakeholder, but ensure you have a clear separation between Stakeholders and Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you have found your users, identify their needs. People may come to you with their idea of a solution <em>("I want you to give me a line graph that shows my sales over the past 2 years")</em> rather than the root problem <em>("I need to find out when and why we underperformed vs the market")</em>. It is your job to take these solutions and find out what problems they are trying to solve!
        </p>
        <h3>
          The 5 Whys
        </h3>
        <p>
          The 5 Whys technique will help you get to the rool of the question, rather than receiving a 'general' request by helping you break down any assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When receiving a request, simply ask why 5 times, delving further into the root cause. A nice example is of what you might expect is laid out below
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally remember, you are not the user. Your idea of the implied significance of certain pros and cons, or different views and answers, are not a good representation of the needs of the final user. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <h2>2) Nurture</h2>
        <p>
          At this point we want to reinforce the 'why' that we discovered in the first phase. Ask yourself what should the dashboard be focusing on, and, more importantly, what should <strong>not</strong> be built.
        </p>
        <p>
          A useful technique at this stage is to create an Affinity Map. To do so, take all your key insights from the Discovery Phase and write them up on postit notes to keep them concise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have all your notes, place them on a board, aligning notes that are similar to each other together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notes place in groups help you to create key themes. These themes help build a view of what the user needs, allowing you to move to the third phase.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <h2>3) Ideate</h2>
        <p>
          From the key themes you created in the previous phase, you can now build insightful User Stories. User Stories are the building blocks of User Centric design.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a User Story, simply structure a card or postit note with the following:
          <ul>
            <li>As a [user]</li>
            <li>I want to [functionality]</li>
            <li>So that [benefit]</li>
            <li>An I know when I am done when [acceptance criteria]</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we have aligned our users needs to specific functions that the dashboard must be able to accomplish, it is time to sketch out some designs designs. These sketches are called wireframes. Try to keep the time taken to sketch each design to less than 5 minutes in order to keep your work free flowing and allow you to think up as many ideas as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you start to run out of Creativity Juice then I recommend taking a look on Tableau Public or in "The Big Book of Dashboards" - both have a plethora of ideas and are guaranteed to answer most of your user stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          When sketching up your wireframes, there are a few basics to keep in mind:
        </p>
        <h3>
          Interaction:
        </h3>
        <div class="basics-grid">
          <h4>
            Avoid Multiple Scroll Zones
            <img src="assets/images/blogs/scroll-zones.JPG" alt="scroll-zones">
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Keep interaction effects, such as filters, on-screen
            <img src="assets/images/blogs/on-screen.JPG" alt="on-screen">
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Be mindful of users' prior experience with Tableau
            <img src="assets/images/blogs/help.JPG" alt="users' experience">
          </h4>
        </div>
        <h3>
          Visual:
        </h3>
        <div class="basics-grid">
          <h4>

          <h4>
            Use colour sparingly and consistently
            <img src="assets/images/blogs/minimum-colour.JPG" alt="minimul colour">
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Use whitespace to group charts and draw attention
            <img src="assets/images/blogs/whitespace.jpg" alt="whitespace example">
          </h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <h2>4) Validate</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have completed the other 3 stages, start developing your dashboard. And throughout the process, cycle as many times as required through the final stage - Validate.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must always be looking for constant feedback, whether from yourself or someone else, and whether formally or informally. Here are a couple ways you can do this:
        </p>
        <h3>
          Break Your Designs
        </h3>
        <p>
          Take a look at your own dashboard and answer the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does it answer your original task?</li>
          <li>Does it make sense?</li>
          <li>Which areas work well? Which don't</li>
          <li>How are your users going to use the dashboard? Which points are confusing?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Lightweight Feedback
        </h3>
        <p>
          Get another pair of eyes on your dashboard. Ask for feedback instantly (preferably within 30-60 seconds of seeing the dashboard), to get their initial impression. Remember, first impressions last, they have already made up their mind if they like your dashboard. Another pair of eyes also might spot things you missed...
        </p>
        <h3>
          UAT
        </h3>
        <p>
          User Acceptance Testing is a fundamental within the development space. It consists of a group of individuals test the dashboard to make sure it can answer the questions posed to it, and according to the desired specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is preferable to be in the room during the testing to watch it being completed. This is time consuming but the benefits are significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also provide specific tasks for the testers to complete, rather than allowing them to flick through aimlessly
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, ask that the testers think aloud. Most people don't talk through what they're thinking whilst they're using a phone or a tablet, and a retrospective summary can miss out valuable 'in the moment' feedback.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          So there we have it. Follow these 4 stages and keep the user at the heart of everything you do and you will see huge benefits and increased success rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I will be releasing a series of blogs on specific formatting guidance within Tableau, to allow you to unlock the full potential of Tableau UX design. But for now, allow these 4 stages to help with the planning of your next dashboard; and do please let me know how you get on!
