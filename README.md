Milestone 2 Project

## 1. [UX](#ux)

##### [User Stories](#User-Stories)

- "As myself (Alex), I want to promote my skills as a data analyts, so I can get job offers"
- "As a company, I want to send Alex an email, so I can request his services on a data project"
- "As a research company, I want to see the analytical portfolio, so I can understand about global trend metrics"
- "As a junior data analyst, I want to see the analytical portfolio, so I can get inspiration for my own work"
- "As a senior data analyst, I want to contact Alex, so I can collaborate on a blog/data visualisation"
- "As a junior data analyst, I want to subscribe, so I can get notified of new posts"
- "As a junior data analyst, I want to visit the blog page, so I can learn new Tableau tips"

##### [Design Choices](#Design-Choices)

- Pagination style with distinct pages for each section
- A video demoing one of my visualisations shows on the front screen to allow users a clear, quick view of what I do, this is supplemented with text and invitations to view my portfolio, my blog and an easy "callback" feature for instant user contact.
- Orange was used as one of the primary colours (#ff6d02) as this links to the branding choices of the main software that I use - Tableau. This was complemented with a dark blue (#00305a) as the main text colour to allow the orange to pop more for action buttons and titles; the blue has been purposefully darkened as I feel this gives a more modern look.
- Poppins is the main font family used which is well suited to large font sizes which feature throughout the page and blends well with the professional style of the website.
- The navbar is hidden away, with Javascript animation to show it full screen, to keep a clean view

##### [Wireframes](#Wireframes)

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create detailed wireframes for each page at a mobile level and then at a desktop level to keep with the Mobile First design approach.

As is to be expected certain elements present in the wireframes did not make it into the project itself but may yet do so further down the line.

You can find my wireframes [here](https://github.com/Magnusson95/MS1-Bere-Cu-Miere/tree/master/wireframes).

## 6. [Testing](#testing)

##### [Internet Browsers](#internet-browsers)

The same process of opening up the live page and meticulously clicking all links, buttons, and re-sizing of windows was utilized in the following browsers:

- Google Chrome - Main browser of choice for development.
- Microsoft Edge â€“ All working as intended besides flex at minimum width
- Mozilla Firefox - No issues. Everything works as intended.
- Safari - All working as intended.

The site has been tested physically on a number of mobile devices including:

- iPhone 5, 7, 10 and 11
- Google Pixel
- Galaxy S9.

Various examples of multiple screen sizes on different pages of the site can be found [here](https://github.com/Magnusson95/MS1-Bere-Cu-Miere/tree/master/wireframes)

##### [Issues and Resolutions](#issues-and-resolutions)

Software hover scale transformation was causing items to overflow, leading to extra, unwanted scrollbars. Reduction of the scale fixed this issue.

Many views required the reordering of entire sections of the webpages when moving between mobile and desktop to get the desired view. Due to the fact I had already advanced through most of the structure and styling, the best way to rectify this was to work with "display: none"

##### [Known Issues](#known-issues)

- All responsiveness working on Microsoft Edge except minimum flex view
